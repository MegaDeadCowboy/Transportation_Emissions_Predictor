### **Interview-Ready Demonstration**
> *"I built a complete Transportation Emissions Predictor with an interactive dashboard that identifies VMT as explaining 76% of state variation. You can see Texas as the highest emitter in dark red on the choropleth map, while California leads in efficiency. The policy simulator shows a 10% reduction in vehicle miles traveled could decrease national emissions by 7.3% - exactly the actionable climate policy insights EcoDataLab develops for state and local governments."*

> *"The dashboard demonstrates end-to-end climate data science capabilities: EPA data integration, advanced statistical modeling, and interactive policy analysis tools. When my initial models overfitted with the small dataset, I pivoted to interpretable approaches and created clear visualizations that policymakers can actually use - the kind of analytical maturity and user-focused thinking EcoDataLab values."*
